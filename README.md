This project was completed as part of my initiative to learn data structures using the Java language in compliance with the University of Texas at Austin's Computer Science Department curriculum for its respective course, CS314 - Data Structures.

The Huffman Project was intended for my advanced application of fundamental data structures concepts, in addition to learning and understanding fundamentals of data compression using the Huffman algorithm. 

All back-end implementations, including the storing and formatting of data, compression and decompression, was completed by me. As for the UI and other low-level classes, such as those for reading-writing binary data, was done by the UTCS Department, notably instructor Michael Scott.

All information regarding implementation and participation is listed per class for transparency and documentation purposes.
